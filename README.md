# Genshin-Teams-Generator
This is a random genshin team generator that I created to practice and subsequently hone my skills in react and get a better grasp on it. 

## How it works
- There are a total of 6 elements (I will add more when dendro comes out) - Hydro, Cryo, Pyro, Geo, Electro and Anemo. 
- You can click on the buttons of these elements to subsequently add any random character of that particular element. 
- If you do not want to choose and instead want the website to choose for you you can simply click on the "Surprise" button which will choose any random four characters from the pool of all the playable characters for you.
- It's understandable that the character chosen might not be available for you. Therefore, you can simply click to change your result to a different character.

## Technologies Used
 - React.js

## Plans
This website will subsequently see many changes as the time goes by as I still have many Ideas for it. So if you have any suggestions please feel free to contact me.
